The file appears to be missing a closing curly brace for the GameBoard component. Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brace added at the end:

```typescript
// ... rest of the file remains the same ...

export default GameBoard;
}
```

The error was that the component's main function declaration was not properly closed. I've added the missing `}` after the `export default GameBoard;` line to properly close the component function.
