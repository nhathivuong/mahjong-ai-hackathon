The file appears to be missing a closing curly brace for the GameBoard component. Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brace added at the end:

[Previous code remains exactly the same until the last line, then add:]

```typescript
};

export default GameBoard;
```

The issue was that the component definition needed one more closing curly brace to match the opening brace after the GameBoard component declaration. I've added it just before the export statement.
